# Randomizer Network DAO - Deployment Contracts

THERE ARE 3 TOKEN TYPES:
1. RN Token = Governance + Utility => can be reclaimed at the end of the game + winnings hopefully
2. NLL Token = Utility => 1 NLL Token = 1 Ticket => The NLL Token is burned after it is used and it is not transferable
3. 5K NFTs = Unique Meta Game Pass access to the Daily No Loss Lottery

THERE ARE 2 NO LOSS LOTTERY TYPES:
1. The 5K NFTs hodlers have a daily chance to win RN Governance Tokens just by hodling.
2. RN Tokens and NLL Tokens are used to purchase tickets in the Daily No Loss Lottery. 

TOKEN FEATURES:
1. RN Governance Token is prevalued and made in circulation
2. NLL Utility Token is non-transferable and only works inside the No Loss Lottery, it's basically 1 free ticket.

HOW THE NO LOSS LOTTERY WORKS:
1. At the end of the daily draw, RN and NLL reward are distributed to 10 lucky winners.
2. For RN Tokens the same reward amount that is given to the 10 winners is also burned at the same time thus making it deflationary. 
3. NLL Tokens are also rewarded to the 10 lucky winners. NLL Tokens are burned when purchase 1 ticket in the daily token no loss lottery.
