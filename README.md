# Randomizer Network DAO - Deployment Contracts

THERE ARE 3 TOKEN TYPES:
1. RANDOM Token = Governance + Utility => can be reclaimed at the end of the game + winnings hopefully
2. RNDD Token = Utility => 1 RNDD Token = 1 Ticket => The RNDD Token is burned after it is used and it is not transferable
3. 5K NFTs = Unique Meta Game Pass access to the Daily Daily Draw

THERE ARE 2 Daily Draw TYPES:
1. The 5K NFTs hodlers have a daily chance to win RANDOM Governance Tokens just by hodling.
2. RANDOM Tokens and RNDD Tokens are used to purchase tickets in the Daily Daily Draw. 

TOKEN FEATURES:
1. RANDOM Governance Token is prevalued and made in circulation
2. RNDD Utility Token is non-transferable and only works inside the Daily Draw, it's basically 1 free ticket.

HOW THE Daily Draw WORKS:
1. At the end of the daily draw, RANDOM and RNDD reward are distributed to 10 lucky winners.
2. For RANDOM Tokens the same reward amount that is given to the 10 winners is also burned at the same time thus making it deflationary. 
3. RNDD Tokens are also rewarded to the 10 lucky winners. RNDD Tokens are burned when purchase 1 ticket in the daily token Daily Draw.
